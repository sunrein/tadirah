# TaDiRAH - Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities

TaDiRAH, which is short for the Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities, is originally found [on the original TaDiRAH website](http://tadirah.dariah.eu/vocab/index.php).
This is a redesigned version of the existing website, created for a course in Digital Humanities at Syracuse University. The intent of the project is to make TaDiRAH more accessible for all users, both in terms of intellectual design but also for patrons using screen readers or other accessibility devices.
This project also includes some updates in the language used to describe these activities, and provides some well-needed examples of techniques in action.
