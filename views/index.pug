  h2 What is TaDiRAH?
  p Taken from the original website: TaDiRAH stands for Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities.
  p This taxonomy of digital research activities in the humanities has been developed for use by community-driven sites and projects that aim to structure information relevant to digital humanities and make it more easily discoverable. The taxonomy is expected to be particularly useful to endeavors aiming to collect information on digital humanities tools, methods, projects, or readings.

  h2 How to Use
  p TaDiRAH is meant to provide a unified set of vocabulary terms, concepts, and methods for digital humanities practitoners. You can use this tool to help brainstorm the best method to create or showcase your project, the tools available for DH, and ways of putting those tools into practice. Use the following links to explore the taxonomy.
