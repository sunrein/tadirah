  h3 Information Retrieval, Capturing, & Basic Manipulations
  p(class="activity-category") These activities generally refer to the process of creating digital surrogates of existing cultural artifacts, or expressing existing artifacts in a digital representation (digitization). This could be a manual process (as in Transcribing) or an automated procedure (as in Imaging or Data Recognition). Such activities precede Enrichment and Analysis activities, at least from a systematic point of view, if not in practice.
  button(class='collapsible') Conversion
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Conversion refers to changing the file format of an object (e.g. converting a .wmv video to a .mov file as well as converting VHS into a digital format) without fundamentally changing the content or nature of the object. When conversion concerns metadata, it involves mapping one metadata schema to another. More fundamental “conversions”, such as converting a scanned page image to an editable text document, are better referred to using Data Recognition.

  button(class='collapsible') Data Recognition
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Data Recognition, for example optical character recognition (OCR), refers to the process of treating the immediate products of digital data capture (recording or imaging), such as digital facsimiles of texts or of sheet music, in a way to extract discrete, machine-readable units from them, such as plain text words, musical notes, or still or moving image elements (including, for example, face recognition).

  button(class='collapsible') Discovering
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Discovering is the activity of seeking out objects of research, research results, or other information which is useful in a given search perspective. Discovery includes very directed techniques such as advanced querying of databases, less directed techniques such as simple searching, and more serendipitous ones as browsing, which would include faceted browsing. (It is different from Information Retrieval, which is a structured way of extracting some piece of information or some specific subset of objects from a resource.)
  br

  button(class='collapsible') Gathering
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Gathering refers to aggregating discovered resources, usually in some structured way (e.g. bringing together all papers that address a certain topic, as part of a literature review, or pulling all works by a particular author out of a digital collection for further analysis). Related techniques include web crawling and scraping.
  br

  button(class='collapsible') Imaging
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Imaging refers to the capture of texts, images, artifacts or spatial formations using optical means of capture. Imaging can be made in 2D or 3D, using various means (light, laser, infrared, ultrasound). Imaging usually does not lead to the identification of discrete semantic or structural units in the data, such as words or musical notes, which is something DataRecognition accomplishes. Imaging also includes scanning and digital photography.

  button(class='collapsible') Recording
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Capturing audio and/or video; the result is a digital audio (e.g. WAV, MP3, etc.) or video (e.g. MP4, Quicktime, etc.) file that can be manipulated, analyzed, and/or stored.

  button(class='collapsible') Transcription
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Transcription is the activity of creating a representation of a manuscript (often in combination with Enrichment) or of audio or video recordings. The representation is (also) generally textual for the verbal aspects of recordings and structured for example by speech turns, but can also contain multimodal information like gestures or events and multimedia information like time synchronization and relation to media files. Transcription that is partial, selective, and/or inherently linked to the source document may be better categorized as Annotation.
  br

  h3 Creation
  p(class="activity-category") Creating things generally refers to the activity of producing born-digital digital objects, rather than creating digital objects by capturing and digitizing existing analog objects. Creating can involve writing natural language text (cf. Writing) or, understood more broadly as the creation of a string of discrete symbols, it could also concern other forms of expression, such as creating executable code (see backend web development), composing a musical score, or creating an image.

  button(class='collapsible') Designing
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td The development of a user interface, with which the user is able to interact to perform various tasks and conduct activities. Also included here is the development of the user experience, where a person’s perceptions of the practical aspects such as utility, ease of use, and efficiency of the system are taken into consideration. Does not include the implementation of the design (see “frontend web development” or “backend web development”). Database design is to be categorized using “Modeling”. In the context of web development, this step would be pseudocoding or wireframing.

  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Programming, or the creation of code executable by a computer, that is creation of scripts or software. (This includes “Prototyping”, the creation of such code for testing or modeling purposes.) It is also closely related to the more broader activity of tool development. Programming is separate from Encoding (enriching a document by making structural, layout-related, semantic, or other information about a specific part of a document explicit by adding markup to its transcription).

  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Writing designates the activity of creating new texts (instead of capturing existing text). In our context, this would primarily concern research papers and reports, but may include other textually-oriented objects..
  br


  h3 Enrichment
  p(class="activity-category") Enrichment refers to the activity of adding information to an object of enquiry, by making its origin, nature, structure, meaning, or elements explicit. This activity typically follows the capture of the object.

  button(class='collapsible') Annotating
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Annotating refers to the activity of making information about a digital object explicit by adding, e.g., comments, metadata or keywords to a digitized representation or to an annotation file associated with it. This can be in the form of annotations that comment on or contextualize a passage (explanatory annotations) in order to make structural or linguistic information explicit (structural/linguistic annotation), as linked open data making the relationships between objects machine-readable, or, in the case of general metadata, adding information about the object as a whole. Encoding is a technique associated with annotating, as are POS-Tagging, Tree-Tagging, and Georeferencing.


  button(class='collapsible') Clean Up
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Data cleanup involves improving the quality of an existing digital object. This could include such things as correcting errors in a written text, errors in OCR results, debugging code, improving the quality of video, audio, or image file.


  button(class='collapsible') Editing
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Editing refers to making structural, layout-related, semantic, or other information about a specific part of a document explicit by adding (inline or stand-off) markup to its transcription. This is typically part of the larger activity of scholarly editing of textual, musical, or other sources. It is based on a transcription of the document (the result of data recognition) and guided by a model of the document (the result of modeling).
  br

  h3 Analysis
  p(class="activity-category") This general research goal refers to the activity of extracting any kind of information from open or closed, structured or unstructured collections of data, of discovering recurring phenomena, units, elements, patterns, groupings, and the like. This can refer to structural, formal or semantic aspects of data. Analysis also includes methods used to visualize results. Methods and techniques related to this goal may be considered to follow Capture and Enrichment; however, Enrichment depends upon assumptions, research questions and results related to Analysis.

  button(class='collapsible') Content Analysis
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Content Analysis is a method which aims to analyse aspects of digital objects relating to their meaning, such as identifying concepts or meaningful units.

  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Network Analysis is a method to study the relations of (real or fictional) actors or other entities in a mediated network, which can take the form of a social or academic online network, a set of correspondence, or a work of literature; the resulting network is usually made up of nodes (entities) and edges (relations). Relevant techniques include Named Entity Recognition. When the artifacts themselves (texts, images, etc.) and their relations are concerned, the corresponding research activity would be Relational Analysis.

  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Relational Analysis refers to computational techniques serving to discover specific relations between several objects of study. In textual studies, this could mean discovering overlap between several different texts (study of text reuse / plagiarism), or textual variations between several versions of one text (collation), or assessing the similarity of texts in terms of stylistic features (stylometry). By analogy, such methods can also be applied to other cultural artifacts, such as music, film or painting. Relevant techniques include Sequence Alignment, Collation, and techniques associated with Stylistic Analysis.
  br

  button(class='collapsible') Spatial Analysis
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Spatial Analysis refers to the discovery of trends or patterns in data pertaining to spatial or geographical aspects of the data. Spatial analysis is often based on techniques of annotation of data, such as Georeferencing or Named Entity Recognition, and may lead to visualization or modeling in the form of maps (see Modeling).

  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr

    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Stylistic Analysis consists of identifying stylistic or formal features of digital objects. Although computational stylistics is in many cases applied to texts and based on linguistic features, it can also be applied to other media such as physical artifacts, painting, music or movies. Relevant techniques include: Stylometry, Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Paleographic Analysis.

  button(class='collapsible') Visualization
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Visualization refers to activities which serve to summarise and present in a graphical form, and to use such graphical forms analytically, that is to detect patterns, structures, or points of interest in the underlying data. Virtually any kind of data can be visualized, and the forms of visualizations can be images, maps, timelines, graphs, or tables, and the like. Relevant techniques include plotting and mapping.

  br

  h3 Interpretation
  p(class="activity-category") Interpretation is the activity of ascribing meaning to phenomena observed in Analysis. Therefore, interpretation usually follows analysis, although it could also be considered that interpretation defines the hermeneutic perspective of any method of analysis.

  button(class='collapsible') Contextualization
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Contextualization is the activity of creating associations between an object of investigation and other, more established or better-understood objects in a relation of geographical, temporal, or thematic proximity to the object of investigation, with the aim of ascribing meaning to that object. Such contextualizing may build on existing annotations and/or metadata.

  button(class='collapsible') Modeling
  div(class='activity-table')
    table
      tr
        th Definition
      tr
        td Modeling is the activity of creating an abstract representation of a complex phenomenon, usually in a machine-readable way, possibly in an interactive way (i.e. it includes “simulation”). Models become machine-readable when modelling produces a schema that describes the elements and the structure of an object of inquiry in an explicit way. Modeling can also refer to the activity of transforming or manipulating a digital object in such a way as to make it compatible with a previously constructed model or schema. Mapping, for instance, is an example of a spatial model. Workflow design is included as part of Modeling, using an object such as Process.

  h3 Meta-Activities
  p(class="activity-category") Meta-Activities are activities which, unlike regular research activities, do not apply directly to a research object, but rather to a combination of a research activity with a research object. A case in point would be a tutorial Teaching the digital Encoding of music, or a report Introducing Pattern Recognition in images. Meta-Activity tags can be added to provide additional context to a typical activity+object pair of tags. In some cases, however, meta-activities may also apply to objects, for example in the case of objects like “Infrastructure” or “Digital Humanities”.
